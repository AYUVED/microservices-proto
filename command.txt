To set up SSH for GitHub, follow these steps:
Generate an SSH key (if you don't already have one):
Bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
2. Start the SSH agent:
Bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

Add your SSH key to the agent:
Bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Copy the public key to your clipboard:
Bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:
Go to GitHub.com and sign in
Click your profile photo, then "Settings"
In the sidebar, click "SSH and GPG keys"
Click "New SSH key"
Paste your key into the "Key" field
Click "Add SSH key"
Test your connection:
Bash
ssh -T git@github.com
If successful, you'll see a message like "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."
After completing these steps, you should be able to use SSH with GitHub. Remember to use the SSH URL when cloning repositories or setting remotes.
